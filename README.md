# Posture Detection Project

## Overview
This project is designed to detect bad body posture using OpenCV and MediaPipe. It alerts users when poor posture is detected, helping them maintain a healthier posture while sitting or standing.

## Features
- **Real-time Posture Detection:** Continuously monitors the user's posture through the webcam.
- **Alert System:** Provides visual or audible alerts when bad posture is detected.
- **Customizable Sensitivity:** Adjust the sensitivity of posture detection according to individual preferences.

## How It Works
The project uses the OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries to capture video input and analyze body landmarks. When the system detects a deviation from the correct posture, it triggers an alert to notify the user.

## Example Use Case
This tool can be used while working at a desk to ensure that users maintain proper posture, reducing the risk of back and neck strain.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the posture detection script:
   ```bash
   python posture_detection.py
   ```

## How to Use
- Ensure your webcam is connected.
- Run the script.
- Sit or stand in front of the camera. The system will monitor your posture and alert you if it detects bad posture.
